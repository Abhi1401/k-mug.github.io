__This "Don't be a jerk" policy is a shortened, more casual version of the longer Code of Conduct policy. [Read full version](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick).__


Kerala Microsoft Users Group prides itself on being an open, respectful, and inclusive community. That means jerky behavior isn’t allowed at K-MUG meetings. Because we know that it’s not obvious to everyone, here’s a reminder of the things we don’t allow: jokes or offensive comments about sex/sexuality/race/religion/nationality/body size, showing porn in public, touching people uninvited, or continuing to interact with someone after they’ve asked you to stop. Continuous jerky behavior may result in getting expelled from the meeting or K-MUG.

If someone is bothering you, please tell K-MUG Community Council immediately and they will take care of it. We want to maintain K-MUG meetup's awesomeness.

* Use ENGLISH only for discussions.
* Only Technology related discussions and posts allowed.
* Strictly NO discussions on topics related to Politics, age, gender, sex, and religion.
* No personal attack.
